Release Notes
-------------

This is a pre-release version of mbrt.  It officially has no version number, but is probably best thought of simply as version 0.0, 
with a build number of whatever revision you happen to have checked out.

Building on Cygwin
------------------

1) You will need to download and build libsigc++ as Cygwin does not current install this library.  mbrt is known to work with version 2.0.18.
2) Rant does not currently ship with Ruby, so you will need to obtain this from the rubygem or other package.
3) The compiler will currently choke on a clean build because Cygwin's g++ creates rt.exe instead of rt for the final executable. The
    simplest solution is to execute  'ln -s rt.exe rt' from the trunk before your first build.
4) All other dependancies should be resolved from a full Cygwin install.  If you are not running a full cygwin install, please see
    the Rantfile to determine what other dependencies will be needed.
